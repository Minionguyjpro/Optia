Subject: [PATCH] Allow multiple callbacks to schedule for Callback Executor

ChunkMapDistance polls multiple entries for pendingChunkUpdates

Each of these have the potential to move a chunk in and out of
"Loaded" state, which will result in multiple callbacks being
needed within a single tick of ChunkMapDistance

Use an ArrayDeque to store this Queue

We make sure to also implement a pattern that is recursion safe too.
